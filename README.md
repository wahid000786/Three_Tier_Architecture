# TWS Three-Tier App Challenge

This repository hosts the #TWSThreeTierAppChallenge for the TWS community. The challenge involves deploying a Three-Tier Web Application using ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB, with deployment on AWS EKS.

## Challenge Overview

The challenge is to build and deploy a Three-Tier Web Application consisting of the following components:

1. **Frontend**: Built using ReactJS, the frontend should provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

2. **Backend**: Built using NodeJS, the backend should handle API requests from the frontend and interact with the database.

3. **Database**: MongoDB will be used as the database for storing application data.

4. **Deployment**: The application should be deployed on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for scalability and reliability.
